Decision Support Systems (DSS) integrate knowledge from Domain Experts
in each of their components: in data and models, in mathematical operations
that processes this data and in the resulting information that supports
the decision-making process. In traditional development methodologies,
this knowledge must be interpreted and implemented by software developers,
because the specialist can not formalize this knowledge in a computable
model to integrate it into the DSS. The knowledge modeling process
is carried out by the developers, biasing domain knowledge and hindering
the agile development of DSSs. Given this situation, it was identified
that there is no computable knowledge representation that allows define
DSSs, that has a format understandable and accessible by the domain
experts and the computers. From that problem, were tested and found
solutions based on semantic web ontologies represent complex knowledge
and provide a format understandable by human and machines. Decisioner
method allowing experts represent their knowledge by means of ontologies
and Domain Specific Languages (DSL), to allow the definition and generation
of SADs. Decisioner Framework implement this method by providing web
ontology edition interfaces and DSL to define and generate the SADs
in web environments. To validate such method, Decisioner Framework
was instantiated with an ontology of sustainability assessment in
sugarcane in the center-south of Brazil and by means of a description
in the DSL of the components of SAD, it allowed the generation the
DSS SustenAgro. Evaluations were carried out in the Framework Decisioner
and in the DSS SustenAgro to validate the proper operation of them.
